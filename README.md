# PluginUpdater
Unfortunately, this is not oLoader. I cannot release that due to contract (and a lot of licenses protected there)

## General Information
* In your server directory, create a new folder named **new_plugins**, when you have a update on a plugin, place it in the new_plugins folder.
* Once done, the startup script should automatically transfer every .jar file to /plugins/ directory.

## Extra Information
* I used to use this back in late 2017-2018. Then friends of mine (@invaded & NoCode) created a 
* plugin named **oLoader**, which helped the OrbitGames Team a lot. Not going to disclose how that works
* thanks for checking this out, if you're a lazy pug then you can use this.
